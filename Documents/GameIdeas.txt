NOTE: THESE ARE JUST SOME BASIC IDEAS. PLEASE FEEL FREE TO ADD OR ADAPT AND ENVOLVE AN IDEA BY YOURSELF!

Goal: Creating a LAN/multiplayer game with a REAL long term motivation, based on a deep sandbox experience

Setting: A medieval middle-European landscape (pine forests, rivers, castles, valleys …). Starting “naked” with no gear and no skills in the middle
of nowhere. Zombies and other monsters seem to scavenge the country and it´s up to the player to find a place in medieval society, master his skills
and defend himself against zombies.

Perspective: 3rd Person or 1st Person. Ideal Case: Ability to switch between both options. My favorite is 1st Person because it´s more realistic 
and creates a thicker atmosphere.

Skill-System: A huge amount of skills to discover and train like “learn by doing”. By doing an activity for the first time (example: finding a 
bow/sword and shoot/swing) the player “discovers the skill and with often usage he increases it.

Basic skills: you can discover basic skills without a teacher or learning a profession: Basic Weapon skills (mace, axe), basic general skills 
(strength, stamina, intelligence, speed), basic various skills (hunting, farming, crafting)

Expanded skills: you can discover expanded skills only with a teacher or learning a profession: Expanded weapon skills (sword, bow, staves, 
crossbow), expanded profession skills (weapon smith, armor smith, architect, merchant, alchemy, tailor), expanded various skills (riding)

Inventory: basic inventory is about 10 – 15 space-units big. The player can wear bag packs with a space up to 40 spaces. 
	Gear: The Player has 2 weapon slots (1 Two hand, 2 One hand, 1 One hand + Shield), 		breast and leg armor, a helmet, 2 rings and
	an amulet. 

Sandbox Elements: the player should always have the motivation to enforce and train his character so we have to give him various sandbox elements:
	Housing: Buying a house in one of the two large cities. You´ll have to be a citizen of the city	and invest a lot of money into it (buying 
	the house, furniture …)
	Quests: The player can make quests to obtain money or other rewards. Everywhere in the 	world are people who need help.
	Hunting: Hunt in the large forests for deer and other animals to sell their skin.

Gathering: Gather materials from the rich resources of the landscape like wood, stone, soil, water, herbs, minerals, food, …

Crafting: Combine items you have found/created to other items: Plank + Nails = new weapon , stick+stone = hammer, … Crafting will take time based 
on your crafting skill.

Professions: By becoming a citizen of a large town you can visit a smith/architect/farmer/… to learn his profession. There will be a skill for 
each profession and by increasing it the player will learn new recipes.
